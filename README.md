# Smart Factory Monitoring ‚Äî OEE & Downtime Aggregation Dashboard

A full-stack Industry 4.0 web application that computes, aggregates, and visualizes machine downtime and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) from raw production and status data.
This system demonstrates end-to-end IIoT data integration, from data processing (Node.js, REST API) to front-end visualization (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) ‚Äî suitable for manufacturing efficiency analysis and real-time factory monitoring.

## üöÄ Features
### Downtime Aggregation
  - Merge automatic (status.json) and manual (manual_status.json) logs.
  - Normalize timestamps with Day.js.
  - Resolve overlapping records (manual data prioritized).
  - Aggregate total downtime (minutes) by:
    - Equipment ID
    - Date
    - Reason
  - REST API endpoint for flexible data access:
    - /downtime ‚Üí All records (CLI-style text)
    - /downtime?equipment=<id> ‚Üí Filter by equipment
  - Web dashboard for real-time viewing:
    - Equipment filter & refresh controls
    - Summary panel per equipment
    - Detailed downtime table

### OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) Calculation
  - Parse status and production data from JSON files.
  - Compute daily metrics:
    - Availability (A) = (Running + Idle) / Total Time
    - Performance (P) = Ideal Cycle Time / Actual Cycle Time
    - Quality (Q) = (Actual ‚Äì Defect) / Actual
    - OEE = A √ó P √ó Q
  - Categorize OEE values:
    - Bad, Minimum, Good, Recommended, Excellent
  - REST API Endpoints:
    - /oee ‚Üí CLI-style daily OEE table
    - /oee/daily ‚Üí Detailed JSON per equipment/day
    - /oee/equipment ‚Üí Average OEE per equipment
    - /oee/overall ‚Üí Global factory OEE summary
  - Interactive dashboard at /dashboard:
    - Equipment filter
    - Daily OEE table
    - Equipment averages
    - Overall summary
